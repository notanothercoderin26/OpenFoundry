-- DF.6 branch pointer contract.
--
-- Branch.transactionRid mirrors Foundry's public Branch object: the pointer
-- is the most recent OPEN or COMMITTED transaction on the branch, never an
-- ABORTED transaction. The application updates this pointer when opening,
-- committing, and aborting transactions; this migration backfills existing
-- rows and repairs any branch that still points at an aborted transaction.
