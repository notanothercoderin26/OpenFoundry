# Functions by runtime

Functions are likely to evolve into a multi-runtime capability in OpenFoundry.

## Current runtime signals

The repo already suggests several function execution modes:

- Go-native control-plane logic
- Node-oriented package simulation and validation via `node_runtime_command`
- Python-enabled semantics through `libs/python-sidecar` (gRPC subprocess) consumed by `ontology-actions-service` for function execution and by `notebook-runtime-service` for notebooks
- SDK-backed external consumption paths
- Data Connection external Functions through configured webhooks via
  `context.sdk.dataConnection.invokeWebhook({ sourceId, inputs })`

## Why this matters

Separating function capability by runtime helps document:

- authoring ergonomics
- execution limits
- packaging requirements
- security and permission models
- external egress governance through Data Connection sources instead of
  ad hoc runtime HTTP calls
