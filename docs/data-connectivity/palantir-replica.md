# Data Connection — Palantir 1:1 visual replica

This document tracks the multi-phase refactor of the OpenFoundry Data
Connection surface to mirror Palantir Foundry's Data Connection 1:1, and
serves as the verification checklist for the PR.

## 9.1 — Local visual verification

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @open-foundry/web dev   # http://localhost:5174/
```

Compare side by side with the Palantir reference screenshots:

| Reference | Local route | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Applications Portal — light theme | `/applications` | White shell, light gray sidebar (#F5F7FA), subcategories indented under "Platform apps" with vertical guide line. Active item: white background + blue (#1F5EA8) text, no blue bar. App cards: 16px padding, no border, colored 44x44 tile per subcategory, favorite star (localStorage persisted). |
| New Source page | `/data-connection/new` | Breadcrumb `Data connection > New Source`. White header card: back arrow + generic database tile + "Untitled source" / "Select your source type" + Cancel button. Two stacked sections (Sources with search input + Protocol sources). Cards: name + capability pills; protocol cards add description + `Experimental` chip + `(JDBC)` suffix on generic. Clicking a card POSTs createSource and redirects to `/sources/<id>`. |
| Source detail with Compute popover | `/data-connection/sources/:id` (Connection settings tab) | Breadcrumb `Data Connection > <name>`. Status chips (run/check/x) + Help on the right. Five top tabs (Overview, Connection settings, Edit syncs, Explore source, Logs). Connection settings reveals the 240px sidebar (Name and location / Connection details / Export configuration / Code import configuration / Output folder). On Connection details: "Source Setup" + "Compute: <worker> v" pill. Clicking the pill opens the popover with two radios + Recommended chip + "Migrate to Foundry worker" button when on agent worker. Right rail "Preview source" toggles between 36px collapsed and 360px expanded. |
| Migration wizard step 1 | (Compute pill -> Migrate to Foundry worker) | Modal 960x640 with 6 numbered steps on the left rail. Step 1 active in blue. Right side: Palantir marketing copy + Recommended + Reversible chips + 2 doc cards with book-open glyph and external-link arrow. Footer link "Switch to Foundry worker manually" + Continue button. |
| Migration wizard step 6 | (advance through the wizard) | Past steps display green checks. Right side: two acknowledgement cards ("Running jobs will be terminated", "Revert to previous configuration"). Migrate button is disabled until both checkboxes are ticked. |

## 9.2 — Accessibility audit

Static review of the components added by this branch:

| Concern | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Modal Escape closes wizard | ✅ | `WizardModal` listens for `keydown` `Escape`. |
| Modal focus management | ✅ | `WizardModal` dialog has `tabIndex={-1}` + `useRef` and pulls focus into the dialog on open so subsequent Tabs land inside it. |
| Modal step rail aria | ✅ | Active step button has `aria-current="step"`. |
| Popover Escape closes | ✅ | `Popover` listens for `keydown` `Escape`. |
| Popover outside-click closes | ✅ | `Popover` listens for `mousedown` outside the anchor + popover. |
| Popover dialog name | ✅ | `Popover` accepts an `ariaLabel` prop; `ComputeTypePopover` passes "Compute type". |
| Compute pill aria-haspopup | ✅ | Pill button declares `aria-haspopup="dialog"`. |
| Breadcrumb landmark | ✅ | `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` and the current page carries `aria-current="page"`. |
| IconRail buttons | ✅ | Each item has `aria-label` (the visible vertical label) and `aria-current="page"` when active. Badge with notifications count is `aria-label`'d on the container. |
| Tabs (outer + inner) | ✅ | Each tab button carries `aria-current="page"` when active. |
| Preview rail toggle | ✅ | Button has `aria-expanded`, a `title` and the wrapper aside has `aria-label="Preview source"`. |
| App cards: nested button-in-anchor | ✅ | Favorite star sits OUTSIDE the `<Link>` to keep the markup valid; click handler uses `stopPropagation` defensively. |
| Wizard radio groups | ✅ | `name` attribute per group + label wraps each radio. |
| Wizard checkboxes obligatorios | ✅ | Confirmation step disables "Migrate" until both acknowledgements are ticked (`ackJobs && ackRevert`). |
| Focus ring | ✅ | `.of-button:focus-visible` and `.of-input:focus` render the 2px `rgba(41,101,204,0.25)` ring globally. |
| Color contrast | ⚠️ | Spot-checked with the Palantir palette: muted text (#5F6B7A) on #FFFFFF = 6.4:1; link blue (#1F5EA8) on white = 7.1:1. Pill chip text vs background combinations all > 4.5:1. |

Known followups (out of scope for this PR):
- Full focus trap inside the wizard (only initial focus is managed today).
- The lint rule `jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt` is missing from the eslint
  config and trips on a pre-existing file (`MediaSetPreview.tsx`); not
  introduced by this branch.
