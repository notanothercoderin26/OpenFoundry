# Foundry AIP Logic and Evals 1:1 parity checklist

Date: 2026-05-11
Scope: public-docs-based parity plan for OpenFoundry's AIP Logic and AIP Evals
surfaces: no-code Logic functions, Logic files, input/block/output boards,
Use LLM blocks, prompts, tools, Query objects, Apply action, Execute function,
Calculator, conditionals, loops, create variables, typed inputs, media/model
inputs, block outputs, final outputs, Ontology edit outputs, debugger, run
panel, run history, unit tests, publishing, versions, comparison view, usage
surfaces, command-line/API invocation, execution modes, project-scoped run
history datasets, Automate integration, branch-aware Logic editing, Logic
metrics, compute usage, evaluation suites, target functions, test cases,
object-set-backed test cases, evaluators, custom evaluation functions, built-in
evaluators, Marketplace evaluator handoffs, multi-target runs, single-test-case
runs, run configurations, iterations, parallelization, run metadata,
experiments, intermediate parameters, Ontology-edit simulations, results
analysis, results datasets, metrics dashboards, trace/debug views, and
production-readiness guardrails for LLM-backed functions.

This document is intentionally implementation-oriented. It does not attempt to
clone Palantir branding, private source code, proprietary assets, screenshots,
or any non-public behavior. The target is **functional parity based on public
Palantir Foundry documentation**: the same product concepts, comparable
Logic/Evals authoring and operational workflows, compatible resource models
where useful, and OpenFoundry-native implementation details that can be tested
locally.

## Parity scope boundary

All checklist work is governed by the
[Foundry public-docs parity policy](../reference/foundry-public-docs-parity-policy.md).
OpenFoundry may implement behavior described in public Palantir documentation,
but contributors must not copy private source, decompile bundles, import
tenant-specific exports, use Palantir branding, or reuse proprietary assets.
The product target is functional parity in an OpenFoundry-native implementation,
not a pixel-perfect clone.

This checklist covers AIP Logic as a no-code function-builder surface and AIP
Evals as a test/evaluation surface for Logic, agent-like functions, and
code-authored functions. It should integrate with the Ontology/Object Views
checklist for object, object set, action, and permission semantics; with the
Functions checklist for published function invocation and versioning; with the
Automate/Rules checklist for Logic effects and staged human review; with the
Media Sets checklist for media-reference inputs; with the Global Branching
checklist for branch-aware Logic resources; with Data Foundation for results
and run-history datasets; and with AIP/model governance for supported LLMs,
capacity, token usage, and security. It should not duplicate those underlying
surfaces.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | Not implemented or not yet verified in OpenFoundry. |
| `partial` | Some surface exists, but behavior is incomplete or not wired end-to-end. |
| `blocked` | Requires a platform dependency, public documentation, or product decision. |
| `done` | Implemented, tested, documented, and verified through UI or API smoke tests. |

## Priority vocabulary

| Priority | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P0` | Required for credible demo workflows that build, run, debug, publish, and evaluate a Logic function over Ontology objects and text. |
| `P1` | Required for Foundry-style AIP Logic and AIP Evals parity beyond simple prompt execution. |
| `P2` | Advanced, governance-heavy, branching, experiment, scale, observability, or marketplace-oriented parity. |

## Official Palantir documentation library

These public docs should be treated as the external behavioral contract while
implementing this checklist.

## Target OpenFoundry resource model

The implementation should define stable OpenFoundry-owned resources that can map
to public Foundry concepts without requiring Palantir RID formats. Compatibility
