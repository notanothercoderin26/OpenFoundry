# Security & governance

This section covers identity, permissions, policy, traceability, and controlled operational change.

## OpenFoundry mapping

- `services/identity-federation-service` — identity, MFA, WebAuthn, OIDC, SAML, RBAC, SCIM, JWKS rotation
- `services/authorization-policy-service` — Cedar-backed authorization decision point (ABAC + RBAC + restricted views)
- `services/audit-compliance-service` — platform audit ledger, retention policies, lineage deletion subsystem
- `services/audit-sink` — Kafka → Iceberg consumer for the `audit.events.v1` stream
- `services/tenancy-organizations-service` — organizations, workspace enrollments, multi-tenancy
- `services/telemetry-governance-service` — telemetry permissions, export policies, monitoring rules
- `libs/auth-middleware` — HTTP auth middleware (claims, session scope, JWKS verification)
- `libs/authz-cedar-go` — Cedar policy engine bindings used by `authorization-policy-service`
- `libs/audit-trail` — structured audit events for the compliance collectors
- `libs/media-scanner` — Sensitive Data Scanner integration (PII detection)
- `apps/web/src/routes/audit`, `/auth`, `/control-panel` — security-oriented UIs
- `proto/auth/*`, `proto/audit/*` — wire contracts (wire-format breakage hits every consumer)

> The `identity-federation-service`, `authorization-policy-service` and `libs/auth-middleware` are designated **security-critical zones** in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md): changes there require extra care and explicit human review.

## Key concerns

- authentication and federated identity (OIDC, SAML, MFA, WebAuthn, SCIM)
- role-based, attribute-based and policy-based authorization (Cedar)
- auditability (immutable ledger + Kafka sink to Iceberg)
- semantic and row/column-level access control via restricted views
- environment and deployment governance (tenancy + telemetry policies)
