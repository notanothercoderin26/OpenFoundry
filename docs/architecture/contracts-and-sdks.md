# Contracts And SDKs

OpenFoundry treats contracts as first-class repository artifacts.

## Source Of Truth

The contract source starts in `proto/`, where domains are split into focused folders. The full set today is:

| Domain | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `ai` | AI / agent runtime, evaluations, guardrails |
| `app_builder` | Application composition + curation contracts |
| `audit` | Audit collection envelopes consumed by `audit-compliance-service` and `audit-sink` |
| `auth` | Identity, authorization, JWT claims |
| `code_repo` | Repository review, branching, commits |
| `common` | Cross-domain primitives (pagination, RID, timestamps, error envelope) |
| `data_integration` | Connector catalogue, sync jobs, virtual tables |
| `dataset` | Datasets, branches, transactions, files |
| `fusion` | Entity resolution / fusion |
| `geospatial` | Geospatial primitives and exploratory analysis |
| `marketplace` | Marketplace / product exchange / federation |
| `media_set` | Media sets, media items, transform runtime |
| `ml` | ML experiments, models, deployments, batch predictions |
| `nexus` | Nexus / spaces / cross-tenant collaboration |
| `notebook` | Notebook runtime, cells, reporting surfaces |
| `notification` | Notification transport, inbox, alerting |
| `ontology` | Ontology schema, instances, links, actions, queries |
| `pipeline` | Pipeline definitions, runs, cron triggers |
| `query` | Edge SQL surface (Flight SQL / saved queries / warehousing / tabular) |
| `report` | Reporting envelopes consumed by `notebook-runtime-service` |
| `runtime` | Runtime / orchestration primitives shared across services |
| `streaming` | Streaming connector control plane |
| `workflow` | Workflow + approvals + Foundry-pattern saga / automation |

Buf configuration lives alongside them in:

- `proto/buf.yaml`
- `proto/buf.lock`
- `proto/buf.gen.yaml`

## Generation Flow

```text
proto/*.proto
   |
   v
of-cli docs generate-openapi / validate-openapi
   |
   v
apps/web/public/generated/openapi/openfoundry.json
   |
   +--> TypeScript SDK
   +--> Python SDK
   +--> Java SDK
   +--> frontend consumers
```

## Artifact Destinations

| Artifact | Path |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAPI contract | `apps/web/public/generated/openapi/openfoundry.json` |
| TypeScript SDK | `sdks/typescript/openfoundry-sdk` |
| Python SDK | `sdks/python/openfoundry-sdk` |
| Java SDK | `sdks/java/openfoundry-sdk` |
| Terraform provider schema | `infra/terraform/providers/openfoundry/provider.schema.json` |
| Web-consumable Terraform schema | `apps/web/public/generated/terraform/openfoundry-provider.json` |

## Operational Tooling

`tools/of-cli` is the Go bridge between proto contracts and generated documentation assets. The root `Makefile` exposes the common flows:

- `make openapi-gen`
- `make openapi-check`
- `make sdk-typescript-gen`
- `make sdk-typescript-check`
- `make sdk-python-gen`
- `make sdk-python-check`
- `make sdk-java-gen`
- `make sdk-java-check`
- `make contracts-gen`
- `make contracts-check`

## Why This Matters

Generated artifacts are not secondary documentation. In OpenFoundry they are part of the platform contract:

- frontend code depends on the generated API shape
- SDKs depend on the checked-in OpenAPI output
- Terraform documentation depends on the provider schema JSON
- CI treats drift as a failure, not as optional cleanup

That makes `proto/` and the generation pipeline a critical review area for any public API change.
