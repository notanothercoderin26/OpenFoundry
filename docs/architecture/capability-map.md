# Capability Map

The fastest way to understand what OpenFoundry is trying to deliver is to read its smoke suites as an executable platform map.

## Capability Phases Encoded In Smoke

| Phase | Scenario | Main Capability Areas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `smoke/scenarios/p0-critical-path.json` | thinnest end-to-end gate: connection → dataset → query → ontology → action, used by CI as the must-pass smoke before per-phase suites |
| P2 | `smoke/scenarios/p2-runtime-critical-path.json` | connectors, datasets, sync, pipelines, queries, streaming, reports, geospatial |
| P3 | `smoke/scenarios/p3-semantic-governance-critical-path.json` | ontology, interfaces, properties, governance-oriented workflows |
| P4 | `smoke/scenarios/p4-developer-platform-critical-path.json` | code repositories, branching, commits, search, developer platform flows |
| P5 | `smoke/scenarios/p5-ai-ml-critical-path.json` | AI providers, knowledge bases, embeddings, training jobs, model workflows |
| P6 | `smoke/scenarios/p6-analytics-enterprise-critical-path.json` | analytics datasets, enterprise-tier behaviors, geospatial exploration |
| Foundry-pattern | `smoke/scenarios/foundry-pattern-full-flow.json` | end-to-end exercise of the four Foundry-pattern surfaces (Automate, Saga, Approval, Pipeline) against a live cluster with Debezium + EventRouter SMT wired (see [`foundry-pattern-orchestration.md`](./foundry-pattern-orchestration.md)) |

## How The Repo Reflects Those Phases

### Runtime and data operations

The P2 flow shows the core operational backbone:

- connect to a source
- sync into datasets
- operate on the data
- expose results through pipelines, queries, streaming, reports, and maps

This is reflected in service folders such as `connector-management-service`,
`ingestion-replication-service`, `dataset-versioning-service`,
`pipeline-build-service`, `sql-bi-gateway-service`, `notebook-runtime-service`,
and `ontology-exploratory-analysis-service`.

### Semantic and governance layer

The P3 flow shows that OpenFoundry is not only a data movement stack. It also models meaning, interfaces, and governed domain structures through ontology-centric APIs.

That capability is reflected in a family of dedicated ontology services:

- `ontology-definition-service` — control plane for schema, governance, and definitions
- `object-database-service` — write authority for object and link instances
- `ontology-query-service` — serving plane for search, graph, views, and KNN
- `ontology-actions-service` — action validation/execution plus the consolidated funnel, function runtime, and rule/policy surfaces

Together with `audit-compliance-service`, `identity-federation-service`,
`authorization-policy-service`, and related shared middleware, these services
implement the CQRS ontology stack described in the architecture documentation.

#### `ontology-actions-service` — runtime detail

`ontology-actions-service` is the dedicated Go binary that hosts the Action
Types runtime extracted from the legacy ontology service. Its router is built by
`server.BuildRouter` in
`services/ontology-actions-service/internal/server/server.go`, and the handlers
themselves live in `libs/ontology-kernel`. Full HTTP contract, environment
variables and Foundry mapping are documented in
[`services/ontology-actions-service/README.md`](../../services/ontology-actions-service/README.md).

Runtime dependencies (configurable via environment variables — defaults match
the in-cluster service map in
`services/edge-gateway-service/internal/config/config.go`):

- **Postgres** — owns the `action_types`, `action_executions` (revert ledger),
  `action_what_if_branches` and `action_execution_side_effects` tables.
  Definition metadata is accessed through the Go
  `domain.NewPostgresDefinitionStore` boundary in `libs/ontology-kernel`.
  Runtime object/link/action hot-path stores are wired through
  Cassandra/Scylla, with idempotent table migrations supplied by
  `libs/cassandra-kernel.OntologyRuntimeMigrations`.
- **`audit-compliance-service`** — every `execute_action` /
  `execute_action_batch` / inline-edit emits a structured audit event (success,
  denied, failure). Failure to deliver is logged but never aborts the action.
- **`notification-alerting-service`** — fan-out of action-driven notifications
  with the TASK M caps (≤ 500 recipients standard, ≤ 50 from a function).
- **`connector-management-service`** — TASK G writeback / side-effect webhooks.
  Writeback failures abort the action with HTTP 400; side-effect failures are
  logged and the action keeps running.
- **`object-database-service`** — write path for object instances and revisions.
  `update_object` / `delete_object` / `create_object` plans are applied through
  the kernel's transactional helpers and a row is appended to `object_revisions`.
- **`ontology-definition-service`** — schema lookups for object types, property
  declarations and link definitions referenced by an action's input/output schema.

Observability:

- Prometheus counters exported from `libs/ontology-kernel/metrics`
  (`action_executions_total`, `action_failures_total{failure_type}`, latency
  histograms).
- JSON aggregation surface at `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{id}/metrics?window=…`
  computed directly from the `action_executions` ledger.

Backend coverage runs through Go tests such as
`go test ./services/ontology-actions-service/... ./libs/ontology-kernel/...`.
End-to-end coverage uses smoke scenarios via
`go run ./tools/of-cli -- smoke run --scenario <file> --output <file>`.

### Developer platform

The P4 flow demonstrates that the platform also includes repository-like development primitives such as branches, commits, search, and review-oriented flows.

That capability maps cleanly onto `code-repository-review-service`, and
connects naturally with `application-composition-service` and
`federation-product-exchange-service`.

### AI and ML

The P5 flow shows provider-backed AI and ML capabilities as first-class parts of the platform rather than bolt-on experiments:

- provider registration
- knowledge base creation
- document ingestion
- semantic search
- model training jobs

This is represented by `agent-runtime-service`, `llm-catalog-service`,
`retrieval-context-service`, `ai-evaluation-service`, `model-catalog-service`,
`model-deployment-service`, and supporting shared Go packages such as
`libs/ai-kernel-go`.

### Enterprise analytics

The P6 flow extends the runtime path into richer analytics and geospatial use cases, reinforcing that the platform is meant to support decision workflows, not only CRUD APIs.

## Practical Reading Tip

If you need to understand a product area quickly, start with the matching smoke scenario and then read:

1. the corresponding frontend route in `apps/web/src/routes`
2. the service directory under `services/`
3. the domain contracts under `proto/`

That path usually gives you the shortest route from user behavior to implementation.
